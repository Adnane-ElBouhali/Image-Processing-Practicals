# Image Processing Practicals

This repository contains the practical work assignments completed for the course "IMA201: Introduction to Image Processing" at Télécom Paris.

## Course Overview

IMA201 covers the fundamentals of digital image processing and analysis, including:

- Image acquisition and digital camera systems 
- Image restoration and enhancement
- Image analysis techniques
- Multi-scale image representations

## Practical Works

This repository includes the following practical assignments:

1. Image Acquisition and Radiometry
   - Visualizing images using GIMP
   - Working with histograms 
   - Implementing contrast changes
   - Exploring dithering techniques

2. Filtering and Restoration
   - Applying linear and median filters
   - Image restoration using inverse and Wiener filters
   - Comparing different filtering approaches

3. Segmentation
   - Implementing edge detection methods
   - Exploring thresholding techniques
   - Applying region growing algorithms
   - Using the watershed algorithm for segmentation

4. Mathematical Morphology
   - Working with structuring elements
   - Implementing basic morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing)
   - Applying advanced morphological techniques (top-hat transform, alternating filters)
   - Using morphological operations for image segmentation

Each practical work focuses on implementing and experimenting with various image processing techniques using Python and libraries such as scikit-image.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- GIMP (for visualization)

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of hands-on exercises in digital image processing, demonstrating practical applications of the concepts covered in the IMA201 course.
